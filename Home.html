    <div class="centered"  style= "color:rgb(11, 8, 8);" > With the increased digitization and democratization of learning, traditional methods of offering and curating content are not sufficient to meet the exploding demand for high quality learning experiences that individuals, educational institutions and corporates need today. Moreover, most content is not accessible today and the process of making content accessible is expensive and cumbersome.
<br>  Continual Engine is dedicated to finding simpler, less expensive and more effective ways to making content accessible and delivering transformative learning solutions.
      We use automation, deep learning, machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing techniques to make the process of content discovery, curation, accessibility and consumption more precise and efficient.</div>
